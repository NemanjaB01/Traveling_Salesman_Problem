# Traveling_Salesman_Problem

Implement the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for 100 European cities on the basis of a
genetic algorithm ( choose a languge you prefer). For this,
create a map of 100 cities on your own and define a function for determining the distance
between 2 cities (straight line distance is accepted in this context). Explain your approach in
detail (specifically, the way your algorithm generates populations, performs mutations, etc.).
Develop your own genetic algorithm, i.e., do not use an existing library that supports such
implementations.
